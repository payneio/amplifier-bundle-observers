# Simple Observer Configuration
#
# Minimal setup with a single code reviewer watching Python files.
# Good starting point for basic code quality monitoring.

          focus: |
            Look for common code issues:
            - Syntax errors and typos
            - Unused imports and variables
            - Missing error handling
            - Code that could be simplified
            - Potential bugs and edge cases
