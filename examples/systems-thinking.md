# Systems Thinking Bundle

Observers focused on systemic analysis, not just code. Great for architecture discussions, planning sessions, and decision-making.

## Usage

```bash
amplifier bundle add examples/systems-thinking.md --name systems-thinking
amplifier run -B systems-thinking
```

## Observers

| Observer | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| systems-dynamics | Feedback loops, stocks and flows, system behavior |
| second-order-effects | Unintended consequences, ripple effects |
| leverage-points | High-impact intervention opportunities |
| bias-detector | Cognitive biases affecting decisions |
| stakeholder-analyzer | Who's affected and how |

## Try It

Start a conversation about a complex decision:

> "I'm thinking about migrating our monolith to microservices. What should I consider?"

The observers will surface systemic considerations you might miss.
